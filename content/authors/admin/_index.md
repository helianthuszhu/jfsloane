I'm a PhD student studying cognitive psychology at UNSW. I received my BA in psychology from the University of Maryland and my Masters of Science in experimental psychology from Syracuse University. My research interests include studying the effects of interruptions and time-pressure on decision-making. I have several years of experience as a teaching assistant for a range of psychology courses. I am also a member of the UNSW Women in Maths and Science Champions Program, where I participate in outreach activities to encourage and inspire women to pursue careers in math and science.
