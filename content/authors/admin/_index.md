I'm a PosDoc in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I received my PhD degreee from the University of Hong Kong, my Master in Medicine from Shanghai Jiao Tong Univerisy and my Bachelor from Chongqing Medical University. My research interests are focusing on the dissection of tumor heterogeneity using multi-omics data genetic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, and
proteomic, metabolic data, etc. Specifically, by interacting the data from single cell sequencing, gut microbiome, metabolites to illusrate the mechanisms of cancer development, progression and therapy, especially immunotherapy.
