<p>Growing up in Baltimore MD, I’ve been a <strong>huge</strong> Ravens fan for as long as I can remember. I’ve always loved American football and I try to watch as many games as I can… regardless of where I’m living in the world. The problem is there are just too many games to watch in any given week. Therefore, my goal for this project was to create a program that tells me the “top” games of the week, depending on a criteria I’ve created. So what’s my criteria?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Favorite teams</strong>: Obviously <span style="color: MediumSlateBlue;">Baltimore Ravens!!</span> And <span style="color: Red;">Kansas City Chiefs</span> (for my partner)</li>
<li><strong>Close games</strong>: Final score within 5 points &amp; combine total score &gt; 35</li>
<li><strong>High scoring games</strong>: Total score &gt;= 40</li>
<li><strong>Multiple lead changes</strong>: At least 2 lead changes from quarter to quarter
</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Helpful resources on APIs</h3>
<ul>
<li>I won’t go into too much detail about APIs, but here are some resources I found particularly useful</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/r-api-tutorial/">R API tutorial</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2017/using-web-apis-from-r/">Using Web APIs from R</a></li>

<div id="notes-before-getting-started" class="section level3">
<h3>Notes before getting started</h3>
<ul>
<li>I’ll be using data from <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/">https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/</a></li>
<li>You need authorization to access this API, so only I can successfully run the code because I have the necessary credentials saved in a safe location on my computer</li>
<li>2 incredibly useful packages: <code>httr</code> and <code>jsonlite</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="load-libraries" class="section level3">
<h3>Load libraries</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>library(here)
library(tidyverse) 
library(janitor)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(RCurl)
library(kableExtra)
library(gt)
library(gmailr)
library(glue)
library(mysportsfeedsR)</code></pre>

<div id="set-parameters" class="section level3">
<h3>Set parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li>In this blog, I’ll go through an example using 2021 pre-season week 1 data</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># for request
season = &quot;pre&quot; # &quot;pre&quot; or &quot;regular&quot;
n_week = 1 # week number

# for data cleaning
close_game_points = 5
close_game_points_total = 35
high_score_points = 40</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="get-request" class="section level3">
<h3>GET request</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This was by far the most challenging part! It’s only a few lines of code, but it took me hours to figure out the formatting of everything</p></li>
<li><p>The API documentation from the website I’m using specifically says:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>“Issue a HTTPS GET request to: <code>https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.1/pull/nfl/{season}/week/{week}/games.{format}</code>”</li>
<li>“Authorization: Basic {encrypted_api_key_credentials}”
<ul>
<li>{encrypted_api_key_credentials} = api_key_token + “:” + password</li>
<li>and then encoding it with base64 encoding</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The first couple of lines of code below are accessing and loading in my credentials and authorization keys<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Then I use <code>httr::GET()</code> to send a request to the API</p></li>
<li><p>I use the <code>glue()</code> function to paste together my URL string that includes the parameters I’ve set above</p></li>
<li><p>I also use the add_header argument to add the Authorization in the specific way the website has instructed</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Note: “auth” is my API key token wrapped in the base64() function</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>When we look at the response, we see the Status = 200 which is exactly what we want to see! This means the request has succeeded yay :smile:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>setwd(here(&quot;../&quot;))
source(&quot;login_creds.R&quot;)

res = GET(glue(&#39;https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.0/pull/nfl/2021-{season}/week/{n_week}/games.json&#39;), 
          add_headers(Authorization = paste(&quot;Basic&quot;, auth)))
res </code></pre>
<pre><code>## Response [https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.0/pull/nfl/2021-pre/week/1/games.json]
##   Date: 2021-08-26 22:25
##   Status: 200
##   Content-Type: application/json
##   Size: 37.4 kB</code></pre>
<p>However, the response is an object that is not very R friendly so…</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I need to convert the response into a character and I’ll use <code>httr::content()</code> to do this</li>
<li>Then, I need to convert the JSON object to an R object using <code>jsonlite::fromJSON()</code> (this function only accepts characters, which is why I used content() first)</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>api_response &lt;- content(res, as=&quot;text&quot;)
api_response &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(api_response, flatten=TRUE) # flatten=TRUE automatically flattens nested data into a single non-nested data frame

<h3>Github Repo…</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MySportsFeeds/mysportsfeeds-r">MySportsFeed Github R</a></p>
<p>Turns out, there’s already an entire Github repo that has a MySportsFeed R wrapper to make the process of getting the data from the API much easier. It’s always good to have a look on github first, especially for popular APIs!</p>
<ul>
<li>I actually used this method at first, but I wanted to learn how to get the data without a wrapper, so that’s why I’ve included the code above and this is included but commented out</li>
<li>Install: devtools::install_github(“MySportsFeeds/mysportsfeeds-r”)</li>
<li>Authenticate using api key</li>
<li>msf_get_results() to get a request for a specific feed and can specify parameters</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># authenticate_v2_x(auth2) # auth without base64()
