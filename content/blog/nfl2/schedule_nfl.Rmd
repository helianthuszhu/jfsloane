```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


I tried to set up the task scheduler to automate running the script, but I don't think it will work because every time the script runs, I need to manually enter a number 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(taskscheduleR)
library(here)

nfl_script <- here("nfl_script.R")

taskscheduler_create(taskname = "nfl_script2", rscript = nfl_script, 
                     schedule = "ONCE", starttime = format(Sys.time() + 62, "%H:%M"))
```
