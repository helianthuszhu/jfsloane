## **Abstract** <br>
Background<br>The original Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) is a widely-known three-item psychological measure which claims to test individuals on intuitive (Type 1) vs. analytic (Type 2) cognitive processing. The CRT became popular because the questions lead the decision-maker to an incorrect, yet intuitive, response that must be avoided in order to arrive at the correct answer. Previous research has shown that emergency physicians and interns are interrupted, on average, 7.1 times per hour (Westbrook et al., 2010). Further, working in a high-pressure and dynamic environment can greatly affect decision-making (Flowerdew, Brown, Russ, Vincent, & Woloshynowych, 2012). We aim to use the CRT to study the role of interruptions and time pressure on the balance of intuitive and analytic kinds of thinking. <br><br>Methods<br> We recruited participants through Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform and they responded to a series of CRT-like questions. Every question was presented across three separate pages, and we allowed participants to go back and forth between the pages in order to re-read parts of the question. All of the questions had a multiple choice answer set, and participants selected the answer they believed to be correct. After every question, participants indicated their level of confidence on a slider ranging from "uncertain/guessing" to "absolutely certain".
